STAT 448 Advanced Data Analysis (2022 Spring), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

Using the data, I am planning to explore differences across sexes of abalone and explore relationships between abalone characteristics and the amount of meat. First, I will provide a general descriptive overview of the data, and point out noticeable differences in sizes and weights for the three sexes. Next, I try to find out different ways to distinguish between the three sexes based on dimensions and weights. Moreover, I will answer the question of how final meat weight is related to dimensions, whole weight, age, and sex.
